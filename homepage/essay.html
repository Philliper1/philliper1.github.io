                <span>Planet Fitness looks just as someone would expect a public gym would look like: greasy, loud, and intimidating. It is basically a glorified sweatshop, with people sweating, banging metal together like a fitness factory. Most people would find those traits to be undesirable, and yet there are people who still decide to pay money to go to Planet Fitness. I was also skeptical of putting in the time and effort towards a desired physical fitness when I was fine and healthy the way I was. There wasn’t a “problem” I needed Planet Fitness to fix. But I checked the place out on 125th street out of curiosity, and I witnessed other people at Planet Fitness using their determination and full extent of their mental and physical resources to constantly break barriers on what they can achieve for themselves, not the obnoxious noises and smells. From this brief experience I was inspired to take on the challenge and give it a try since so many people were proving it to be worth making those sacrifices for their personal gain.</span><br>
                <span>However, those people also come in prepared to make the most of their time at Planet Fitness. They visualize a goal they want to achieve. Research a plan to achieve success. Warm up their body for the incoming challenges with adequate rest and nutrients. Then, once inside Planet Fitness, these people follow their plan of action by pushing their bodies to the limit. Trying to improve upon their performance from last session. Always keeping in mind, “One more rep,” while they reach failure of their body, or their resolve, as they inch closer to the reward of a stronger version of themself from experimentation of the maximum amount of stress they can handle. Then they repeat this process for weeks, months, and even years, setting new targets during their journey of development. To most New Yorkers that would sound like the equivalence of having a job, but without the money. The people at Planet Fitness don’t work for money, but for themselves. They grow their body and mind rather than their wealth. They are the ones in control of their own wages, not someone else with authority. To an outsider it may seem like a grueling chore. They wouldn’t see the benefit outweighing the cost. But to the people who regularly spend their time at Planet Fitness, they have decided that the benefits they have been exposed to are worth the trouble, and treat the experience as more of a hobby. The actual labor that comes with experiencing Planet Fitness is overshadowed by the self satisfaction of being responsible for their own progression towards a lifestyle they feel passionate about accomplishing.</span><br>
                <span>That is what you will find at Planet Fitness: passion. The regular day-to-day pedestrians here show a side of themself they wouldn’t find anywhere else in NYC. No two people in Planet Fitness are working towards the same goal, yet they are all gathered together in this one place as a means to fulfill that objective. While being a public place, most people work on their gains at Planet Fitness independently, and some even have training partners to motivate them further, but they are all different in what they want to achieve, what they believe they can achieve, and what they do to achieve their goal. Even while hosting such a diverse group of people, Planet Fitness still finds a way to accommodate all these different aspirations with a wide variety of equipment, machines, and space. It is a wonderland that encourages people to be the leader of their own journey towards self-understanding through their enthusiasm for fitness.</span>
